      <description>Last year I spent seven months in jail. With nothing else to do I read the bible a few times. I grew up in &amp;ldquo;bible-believing&amp;rdquo; churches but the whole thing always felt shallow. As I read the bible with fresh eyes I was shocked and angered by a startling reality: the modern evangelical church is built on lies. Over and over the bible directly contradicted beliefs that I had been taught were gospel truths.</description>
