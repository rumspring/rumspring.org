      <description>The decline of Christianity in the west is accelerating and taking with it the entire American experiment. For thoughtful followers of Jesus we&amp;rsquo;re all wondering &amp;ldquo;What can be done?&amp;rdquo;
Rumspring is a new Austin, Texas based church, founded on crypto-amish principles, that is rethinking church in the decentralized age.
Throughout the history of God’s people there has been only one answer to calamity: return to God’s word and obey. But today, even the most vocal “bible believing” churches have been reduced to adult daycares, worshipping at the altar of emotionalism and “niceness” while staunchly refusing to consider biblical perspectives that don’t fit their narrow conservative cultural traditions.</description>
