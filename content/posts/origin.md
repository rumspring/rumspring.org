Rumspring: A Crypto-Amish Electric Church Boogaloo

The decline of Christianity in the west is accelerating and with it the entire American experiment. For thoughtful followers of Jesus it urgently begs the question “What can we do?!”

Throughout the history of God’s people there has been only one answer: return to God’s word and obey. But today, even the most vocal “bible believing” churches have been turned into an adult daycare, worshipping at the altar of emotionalism and “niceness” while staunchly refusing to consider biblical perspectives that don’t fit their narrow conservative cultural traditions.

The message of Jesus is not conservative but entirely radical. A cursory glance at the New Testament destroys any notion of a safe-for-the-whole-family religion for a radically different life empowered by the spirit. Many younger Christians correctly identify the emptiness of the modern church-- but the conservative church refuses to acknowledge or respond to their real grievances thus becoming the very stumbling block that causes them to reject a biblically grounded faith while they are seduced by the siren song of leftist progessive religion.

Rob Dreher, in his foundational 2017 book, The Benedict Option, made this insightful argument:

“Today, a new post-Christian barbarism reigns. Many believers are blind to it, and their churches are too weak to resist. Politics offers little help in this spiritual crisis. What is needed is the Benedict Option, a strategy that draws on the authority of Scripture and the wisdom of the ancient church. The goal: to embrace exile from the mainstream culture and construct a resilient counterculture.”

The purpose of Rumspring is to flesh out the implications of this vision and actually implement a real world community that embodies these principles. Christianity in the west was largely established by the free church: congregationalists, puritans, separatists, anabaptists and non-conformists. These are people who believe the church should be separate from the state and free from oppressive religious hierarchies. They believe the church is a dynamic group of people acting locally under the headship of Jesus rather than a religious power structure that dogmatically impose its will on the local body of believers. It’s these free-thinking Christians that had the courage to cross a vast ocean in search of the City on a Hill. In contrast, today we see authoritarian Christian groups such as Catholicism, Presbyterianism, Episcopalism, Lutheranism, and Methodism rapidly dying in a decentralized world. These traditions are structurally incapable of responding to the rapid changes happening in the west and so we will focus on the deep, rich history of Christians who have embraced a decentralized faith rooted in the foundation of Jesus Christ alone.

In addition to this blog I am launching a youtube channel. I hope both venues can serve as companion pieces with the blog focused on communicating with an older generation, the “conceptualizers” as Marshal McLuhan called those operating under a text based environment, and the youtube channel being a more experimental medium focused on communicating with digital natives.
Over the next couple months we are going to deep dive on the following Rumspring principles. These are not static principles but the beginning of a conversation to explore what a biblical decentralized church looks like in the digital age.

17 Principles of the Rumspring Crypto-Amish Electric Church Boogaloo

Interactive gatherings. The bible is absolutely clear that when God’s family gathers it must be an interactive gathering. Everyone has an opportunity to share. After someone speaks you debate to discern if he is speaking the truth. No topics are off limits and no pastor can ban topics from public discourse. (1 Cor 14:26-25)
No paid pastors. We are all ministers of the word. Paid pastors pervert and destroy nearly everything they touch. Jesus made it very clear that paid pastors will abandon and betray the sheep. (John 10:12-13)
Financial transparency. All church finances must be made available to all members of the church via a member portal and real-time API.
Real male leadership. While many conservatives claim to hold to orthodox views in theory, in practice that have completely turned the church over to effeminate men who value feelings over the truth.
Love feast. Jesus gave his followers the Lord’s table as a meal. For the first couple hundred years of the church it was always practiced as a meal. Religious leaders turned an exciting meal into a worthless ritual that they can control. Crackers and juice have nothing to do with what Jesus gave to his disciples.
Non-violence. The modern church has embraced violence. From supporting imperialistic wars abroad to the militaristic police state destroying people in America. Even within our own churches we have shamelessly embraced using the violence of the state against each other. Blood is on our hands.
No lawsuits among members. The bible is absolutely clear we should not be suing each other. The church must develop the human and procedural processes to conduct fast, digital Christian arbitration between members and enforce church discipline. (1 Cor 6:1-11)
No divorce. The modern church has wholesale embraced divorce. Divorce was completely unheard of for the first 1500 years of the church and has only been embraced in the last 75 years. Generations of children have been destroyed by these adulterous beliefs. (1 Cor 7:10-11)
No debt. The bible is very clear that debt, either held by the individuals or the congregation, is a form of enslavement that enslaves you to someone other than Jesus and must be fully rejected. (Rom 13:8)
No government education. All children must be trained in house via a church co-op. The church must absolutely oppose the systematic and normalized feeding of our children to the wolves.
No government health insurance. The government and corporate based healthcare system destroys people on many different levels. The alternative is local, holistic medicine with a church fund that provides care when modern medicine is required.
No government social security. The church must be responsible for caring for it’s older members rather than shipping them off to Florida to die alone. The social security and other government based retirement programs are inhumane and place faith in human institutions rather than in God.
All members given a debit card to the church’s bank account. Sound impossible? Think again. In God’s kingdom there is no “father” but rather “brothers” and using proper financial controls and human processes this is absolutely sustainable.
Special projects fund. Without the financial burden of paying for the pastor’s lifestyle and their phallic building projects, the church can focus on investing in member’s projects and serve as an incubator for funding kingdom ventures-- business, education, and community projects.
Privacy. All church and member communication will happen on end-to-end encrypted platforms hosted on church servers. This will be part of a broad effort to protect members from the world's system of technological control.
Church splits baked in. When Amish groups reach 300-400 people they tend to naturally split. Given Dunbar’s number and the realities of group dynamics, group splits should be baked in from the beginning so they are not a point of contention but an opportunity for growth.
Open source infrastructure. The church will make a concerted effort to invest in open source projects.
