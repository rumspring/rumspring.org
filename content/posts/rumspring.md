Last year I spent seven months in jail. With nothing else to do I read the bible a few times. I grew up in "bible-believing" churches but the whole thing always felt shallow. As I read the bible with fresh eyes I was shocked and angered by a startling reality: the modern evangelical church is built on lies. Over and over **the bible directly contradicted beliefs that I had been taught were gospel truths.** Later as I studied church history I realized most of these false beliefs have been completely made up in the last couple hundred years.

**Rumspring is an experimental new church that seeks to ask hard questions and recapture the spirit and truth of the early church.**

It's time for radical action. Christianity is declining in the west and taking America with it. So-called "bible believing" churches have been reduced to an adult daycare, worshipping at the altar of emotionalism and “niceness” while staunchly refusing to consider biblical perspectives that don’t fit their conservative cultural traditions.

The message of Jesus is not conservative but radical. A cursory glance at the New Testament destroys any pretense of a safe-for-the-whole-family religion with a call for a radical spirit-empowered life. Many Christians I know see and feel the emptiness of the modern church. Yet the church refuses to acknowledge or respond to true grievances. It has become the very stumbling block that causes people to reject a biblically grounded faith for the siren song of leftist progressive religion.

Rob Dreher, in his foundational 2017 book, [The Benedict Option](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KUCY7XI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), made this urgent appeal:

> Today, a new post-Christian barbarism reigns. Many believers are blind to it, and their churches are too weak to resist. Politics offers little help in this spiritual crisis. What is needed is the Benedict Option, a strategy that draws on the authority of Scripture and the wisdom of the ancient church. The goal: to embrace exile from the mainstream culture and construct a resilient counterculture.

Rumspring is a new church that is seeking to work out the implications of this call: returning to the word, rediscovering church history, and taking real world action.

Join me over the next couple months to rediscover the old truths that have been forgotten as we explore what a biblical, decentralized, local church looks like in the digital age.

### 18 Principles of the Rumspring Crypto Amish ###

**1. Interactive gatherings.** The bible is clear that when God’s family gathers it must be an interactive gathering. Everyone has an opportunity to share. After someone speaks we debate to discern the truth. No topics are off limits and no pastor can ban topics from family discussion. (1 Cor 14:26-25)

**2. No paid pastors.** We are all ministers of the word. Paid pastors pervert and destroy nearly everything they touch. Jesus made it very clear that paid pastors will abandon and betray the sheep. (John 10:12-13)

**3. Financial transparency.** All church finances made available to all members of the church via a member portal and real-time API.

**4. Real male leadership.** While many conservatives churches theoretically hold to orthodox views on gender, in practice the church has been entirely turned over to effeminate men who value feelings over the truth. Men have left the church in droves and for good reason. 

**5. Love feast.** Jesus gave his followers the Lord’s table as a meal. For the first couple hundred years of the church it was always practiced as a meal. Religious leaders turned an exciting, interactive meal into a vain ritual that can be controlled. Crackers and juice have nothing to do with what Jesus gave his people.

**6. Non-violence.** The modern church has embraced violence. From supporting imperialistic wars abroad to the militarized police state destroying people at home. The military complex and domestic spy network that was built by foolish conservatives has now been turned to destroy the very people who birthed it. Blood is on our hands and we must re-examine Jesus teaching on non-violence.

**7. No lawsuits among members.** The bible is absolutely clear we should not sue each other. The church must develop the human and procedural processes to conduct fast, digital arbitration between members. (1 Cor 6:1-11)

**8. No divorce.** The modern church has wholesale embraced divorce. Divorce was completely unheard of for the first 1500 years of the church and has only been embraced in the last 75 years. Generations of children have been destroyed by these treacherous false beliefs. (1 Cor 7:10-11)

**9. No debt.** The bible is very clear that debt, whether held by the individuals or the congregation, is a form of enslavement that binds you to someone other than Jesus and must be fully rejected. (Rom 13:8)

**10. No government education.** All children must be trained in house via homeschooling and a church co-op. The church must absolutely oppose the systematic and normalized feeding of our children to the wolves.

**11. No government health insurance.** The government and corporate based healthcare system destroys people on many different levels. The alternative is local, holistic medicine with a church fund that provides care when modern medicine is required.

**12. No government social security.** The church must be responsible for caring for it’s older members rather than shipping them off to Florida to die alone. The social security and other government based retirement programs are inhumane and place faith in human institutions rather than God.

**13. All members given a debit card to the church’s bank account.** Sound impossible? Think again. In God’s kingdom there is no “father” but rather “brothers” and using proper financial controls and human processes this is sustainable.

**14. Special projects fund.** Without the financial burden of paying for the pastor’s lifestyle or their phallic building projects, the church can focus on investing in member’s projects and serve as an incubator for funding kingdom ventures-- business, education, and community projects.

**15. Privacy.** All church and member communication will happen on end-to-end encrypted platforms hosted on church servers. This will be part of a broad effort to protect members from the world's growing technological panopticon.

**16. Church splits baked in.** When Amish groups reach 300-400 people they tend to naturally split. Given Dunbar’s number and the realities of group dynamics, group splits should be baked in from the beginning so they are not a point of contention but an opportunity for growth.

**17. Open source infrastructure.** The church will make a concerted effort to invest in open source projects. 

**18. Usury.** For the first 1,500 years of the church usury (charging interest for loans) was universally condemned by the church.
