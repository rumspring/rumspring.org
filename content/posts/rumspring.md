The decline of Christianity in the west is accelerating and taking with it the entire American experiment. For thoughtful followers of Jesus we're all wondering "What can be done?"

**Rumspring is a new Austin, Texas based church, founded on crypto-amish principles, that is rethinking church in the decentralized age.**

Throughout the history of God’s people there has been only one answer to calamity: return to God’s word and obey. But today, even the most vocal “bible believing” churches have been reduced to adult daycares, worshipping at the altar of emotionalism and “niceness” while staunchly refusing to consider biblical perspectives that don’t fit their narrow conservative cultural traditions.

The message of Jesus is not conservative but radical. A cursory glance at the New Testament destroys any notion of a safe-for-the-whole-family religion with a call for a radical spirit-empowered life. Young Christians see the emptiness of the modern church-- but the conservative church refuses to acknowledge or respond to their real grievances, becoming the very stumbling block that causes them to reject a biblically grounded living faith for the siren song of leftist progessive religion.

Rob Dreher, in his foundational 2017 book, [The Benedict Option](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KUCY7XI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), made this urgent appeal:

> Today, a new post-Christian barbarism reigns. Many believers are blind to it, and their churches are too weak to resist. Politics offers little help in this spiritual crisis. What is needed is the Benedict Option, a strategy that draws on the authority of Scripture and the wisdom of the ancient church. The goal: to embrace exile from the mainstream culture and construct a resilient counterculture.

Rumspring is working out the implications of this call and implementing it in the real world.

No answers will come from the establishment church but from its dissidents. Christianity was brought to the west by the free church: puritans, congregationalists, separatists, anabaptists and non-conformists. These were people who believed, **1) the church should be separate from the state**, and **2) the local church acts under the headship of Jesus alone and not under political religious hierarchies.** It’s these free-thinking Christians that had the courage to cross a vast ocean in search of a City on a Hill. In stark contrast, authoritarian Christian groups like Catholicism, Presbyterianism, Episcopalism, Lutheranism, and Methodism are rapidly dying in a decentralized world. These traditions are structurally incapable of responding to the rapid changes happening in the west. Rumspring joins with the long, rich history of Christians who have embraced a decentralized faith rooted in the foundation of Jesus Christ alone.

In addition to this blog I am launching a youtube channel. I hope both venues can serve as companion pieces, with the blog focused on communicating to an older generation (the “conceptualizers” as Marshal McLuhan called those operating under a text based culture) and the youtube channel focused on communicating with digital natives.

Over the next couple months we are going to explore the core principals of Rumspring. These are not static principles but the beginning of a conversation to explore what a biblical, decentralized, local church looks like in the digital age.

### 17 Principles of the Rumspring Crypto-Amish Church ###

**1. Interactive gatherings.** The bible is clear that when God’s family gathers it must be an interactive gathering. Everyone has an opportunity to share. After someone speaks we debate to discern the truth. No topics are off limits and no pastor can ban topics from family discussion. (1 Cor 14:26-25)

**2. No paid pastors.** We are all ministers of the word. Paid pastors pervert and destroy nearly everything they touch. Jesus made it very clear that paid pastors will abandon and betray the sheep. (John 10:12-13)

**3. Financial transparency.** All church finances made available to all members of the church via a member portal and real-time API.

**4. Real male leadership.** While many conservatives churches theoretically hold to orthodox views on gender, in practice the church has been entirely turned over to effeminate men who value feelings over the truth.

**5. Love feast.** Jesus gave his followers the Lord’s table as a meal. For the first couple hundred years of the church it was always practiced as a meal. Religious leaders turned an exciting, interactive meal into a vain ritual that can be controlled. Crackers and juice have nothing to do with what Jesus gave his people.

**6. Non-violence.** The modern church has embraced violence. From supporting imperialistic wars abroad to the militarized police state destroying people at home. The military complex and domestic spy network that was built by foolish conservatives has now been turned to destroy the very people who birthed it. Blood is on our hands and we must re-examine Jesus teaching on non-violence.

**7. No lawsuits among members.** The bible is absolutely clear we should not sue each other. The church must develop the human and procedural processes to conduct fast, digital arbitration between members. (1 Cor 6:1-11)

**8. No divorce.** The modern church has wholesale embraced divorce. Divorce was completely unheard of for the first 1500 years of the church and has only been embraced in the last 75 years. Generations of children have been destroyed by these treacherous false beliefs. (1 Cor 7:10-11)

**9. No debt.** The bible is very clear that debt, whether held by the individuals or the congregation, is a form of enslavement that binds you to someone other than Jesus and must be fully rejected. (Rom 13:8)

**10. No government education.** All children must be trained in house via homeschooling and a church co-op. The church must absolutely oppose the systematic and normalized feeding of our children to the wolves.

**11. No government health insurance.** The government and corporate based healthcare system destroys people on many different levels. The alternative is local, holistic medicine with a church fund that provides care when modern medicine is required.

**12. No government social security.** The church must be responsible for caring for it’s older members rather than shipping them off to Florida to die alone. The social security and other government based retirement programs are inhumane and place faith in human institutions rather than God.

**13. All members given a debit card to the church’s bank account.** Sound impossible? Think again. In God’s kingdom there is no “father” but rather “brothers” and using proper financial controls and human processes this is sustainable.

**14. Special projects fund.** Without the financial burden of paying for the pastor’s lifestyle or their phallic building projects, the church can focus on investing in member’s projects and serve as an incubator for funding kingdom ventures-- business, education, and community projects.

**15. Privacy.** All church and member communication will happen on end-to-end encrypted platforms hosted on church servers. This will be part of a broad effort to protect members from the world's growing technological panopticon.

**16. Church splits baked in.** When Amish groups reach 300-400 people they tend to naturally split. Given Dunbar’s number and the realities of group dynamics, group splits should be baked in from the beginning so they are not a point of contention but an opportunity for growth.

**17. Open source infrastructure.** The church will make a concerted effort to invest in open source projects.
