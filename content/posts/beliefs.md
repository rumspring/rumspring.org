While many assume that the core beliefs of the Amish and Mennonites are the same as others in nominal Christianity, that's not really true. Yes, we believe that we are saved by the work of Jesus on the cross and that no amount of good works will bring us into right standing with God.

But as it says in Romans 3:25 it is for "remission of sins that are past". The book of James describes the qualities of the living faith that is accepted by God. By saying that, we mean this, a true Christian is one who has experienced a radical change in life. True Christians are not habitual sinners.
